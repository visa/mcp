/**
 * Clear action node - final node in delete card subgraph.
 * Clears the private_action to allow router to return to MODE-based routing.
 * Also clears ALL card-related state after the delete operation completes.
 *
 * This node runs after DELETE_TOKEN → SIGNAL_UI_CARD_DELETED.
 * The signal node forces a checkpoint, ensuring the UI receives
 * the cardDeletionSignal increment before this node clears other state.
 *
 * NOTE: Does NOT reset cardDeletionSignal - it stays incremented to avoid timing issues.
 *
 * Clearing the private_action signals to the router that it should re-evaluate
 * based on mode and state.
 *
 * Only clears mode if it was set to DELETE_CARD. This allows delete action
 * to work as an interrupt without breaking other flows (e.g., if user is in
 * USER_INTENT mode and deletes card, they return to USER_INTENT).
 *
 * @param state - Current graph state
 * @returns Partial state with private_action cleared, mode conditionally cleared, and all card data cleared
